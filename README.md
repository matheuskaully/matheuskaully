# Matheus Ka√∫lly | Developer and Amateur Design. ![Profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=matheuskaully&color=blueviolet)

I'm a front-end developer focused on the most widely used language in the world: JavaScript. I have experience with frameworks like ReactJS, AngularJS, and TypeScript, along with other technologies that work great together to build modern, efficient interfaces.

I'm always learning and looking for ways to grow, keeping up with the latest trends and updates in tech.
Like many dreamers out there, I truly believe that technology has the power to change lives and I have faith it will change mine someday.
